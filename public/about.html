<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 17 year old high school student that is attending early college classes. Web design has always intrigued me since I
was younger. The idea of people using different codes and files to make websites look more appealing to the human eye is
fascinating. I've learned other coding languages before but HTML has something that is more human about it that I love.
