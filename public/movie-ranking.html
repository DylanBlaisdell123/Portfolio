<h1>The Best Movies According to Dylan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>Great Sci-Fi movie with an addictive story. I purposely avoid watching this movie so it never gets old.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>The greatest superhero movie of all time, tying all previous Marvel Movies together.</p>
<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<p>Arguably the most artistic and genuinely scary horror movies of our current time.</p>
